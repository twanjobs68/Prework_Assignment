      <h3><b>Welcome to About Me(My Story page)!! YEAH!!<b></h3>
          <p> Let's Get To Know each other!</p>
          <p> Well!  I'm the proud mother of 5 with my oldest being 33 and youngest being 13!.  LOL! I know what
              you are thinking...2 bad nights of Alize'! LOL!  Oh well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.<br/>  I've programmed
              most of my adult working life and love to do just that.  It just happens that Cobol is a dinosaur when it comes to our lanquages.  Being
              away from coding for almost 6 years didn't help my career either.<br/>  So here I am trying to get back in to the saddle any way I can. I know I'm
              gonna enjoy learning new languages and with a platform and friends with knowledgeable instructors behind me, I don't see why I can't ace this
              thing called Software Engineering!! That's it for now!!  KEEP CODING!!!</p></br>
